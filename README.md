Alphabet Soup: Create a function that will arrange the letters of a given word to be in alphabetical order.

```python
lower() #shifts all the case of the letters into lowercase to allow proper comparisson of ASCII values.
list() #Turns the given word into a list separating each letter of the word to its own element within the list.
sort() #Sorts the elements of the specified list into alphabetical order based on the letter's given ASCII Value.
''.join() #Joins the elements of the list into a single string. ('') indicates that it will do so with no spaces in between each element.
```

Emoticon Problem: Create a function that changes a specific word into an emoticon within the given phrase.

```python
Sentence.lower() #shifts all the case of the words into lowercase to make sure the word corresponds with the reference word later on.
if #allows the code to verify if a given scenario is met.
in #checks for a given string within the phrase.
replace() #replaces the word with its respective emoticon equivalent.
```

Unpacking List Problem: Unpack a given list into its first, middle, and last segments then print all three variables.

```python
split() #splits the string into a list if there are spaces or newlines in between it considers that text as one element.
len() #returns the total amount of items in the list, will be used to set a range for setting variables later on.
```
